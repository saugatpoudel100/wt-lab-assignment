                           SORTING OF ARRAY

Introduction:

            Sorting is a process by which we can arrange the elements of a list in a 
            specific order i.e. ascending or descending order. We can say sorting is the
            process of putting a list or a group of items in a specific order. Sorting may 
            be alphabetical or numerical.

            In PHP, sorting is a process of arranging the elements of an array in a specific
            order i.e. ascending or descending order. Using sorting you can analyze a list in
            a more effective way. You can sort an array by value, key or randomly. In most
            situations, we need to sort an array by value.


            Some sorting functions are as follows:

             * sort()
             * asort()
             * rsort()
             * arsort()
             * kshort()
             * ushort()


Examples:


Example 1: Sort Integer Array in Ascending Order
For instance, if you want to sort an integer array in ascending order, use the PHP sort Function.

<?php
  $array = array(5, 1, 2, 7, 3);
  sort($array);
  print_r($array);
  /*
  Array
  (
      [0] => 1
      [1] => 2
      [2] => 3
      [3] => 5
      [4] => 7
  )
  */
?>
Similarly, you can sort the array in descending order using PHP rsort Function.

Example 2: Sorting Associative Arrays
However, to sort an associative array in PHP, use the asort Function to maintain the key-value relationship.

<?php
  $array = array('b' => 'banana', 'c' => 'cat', 'a' => 'apple');
  asort($array);
  print_r($array);
  /*
  Array
  (
      [a] => apple
      [b] => banana
      [c] => cat
  )
  */
?>
Example 3: Passing Comparison Sort Function
Also, you can pass a comparison function in PHP usort Function for sorting arrays in PHP.

<?php
  function compare($a, $b) {
    if ($a == $b) {
      return 0;
    } else if ($a > $b) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
  }
  $testArray = array(4, 2, 1, 5, 3);
  usort($testArray, 'compare');
?>
Example 4: Sorting Arrays in PHP by Keys
Similarly, you can sort an Associative Array according to keys instead of values using the ksort Function in PHP.

<?php
  $testArray = array(1 => 5, 0 => 6, 4 => 3, 3 => 2, 2 => 1);
  ksort($testArray);
  print_r($testArray);
  /*
  Array
  (
      [0] => 6
      [1] => 5
      [2] => 1
      [3] => 2
      [4] => 3
  )
  */
?>
Alternatively, you can use the krsort function to sort array in descending order according to keys.
