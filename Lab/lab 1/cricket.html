          <h2><b>WHAT IS CRICKET?</b></h2>
          <p>Cricket is a game of strategy between two teams. Each team bats and fields in turn – the batters try to score runs; the fielders try to stop them. The team with the most runs wins.

            A run is scored when the striking batsman (the batsman that the bowler is bowling to) runs from one crease line to the other, after hitting the ball.</p>

               <aside>Cricket is played between two teams each made up of eleven players. (Sometime in junior competitions you will find 8 player teams).
                Games comprise of at least one innings where each team will take turns in batting and fielding/bowling.
                The fielding team will have a bowler bowl the ball to the batsman who tries to hit the ball with their bat.</aside>

                The fielding team tries to get the batsmen out by…
                Hitting the wickets with the ball when bowling
                Catching a batsman’s shot on the full
                Hitting the batsman’s leg in front of the wicket (LBW)
                Or hitting the wickets before the batsmen can run to the other end of the pitch.

                The batmen try to score as many runs as possible before getting out by…
                Hitting the ball and running between the wickets and making it to the other end before the fielders can hit the wickets with the ball. Each time you run one full length of the pitch it equals 1 run.
                Hitting the ball to the boundary along the ground is 4 runs.
                Hitting the ball over the boundary on the full equals 6 runs.
